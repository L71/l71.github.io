## MS20 VCF module

This Eurorack module is base on this schematic:

After breadboarding the circuit I decided to create a eurorack module out of it. 
There are a few component value changes compared to the original but most of it is identical. 

The filter has a very wide frequency range and can be used as a lowpass gate. It also self-oscillates.

The filter can also be used to create synth drum type sounds if used with an envelope generator connected to a CV input and the peak/resonance control turned up.

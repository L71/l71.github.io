## Introduction

Hello and welcome! :)

This page is maintained by me, Lars Bengtsson. 

These pages contain information and some build notes mostly about the series of Eurorack synthesizer modules that I have built. The actual files can be found in these [GIT repositories](https://github.com/L71?tab=repositories).  

The modules should not be hard to build by experienced DIYers but that is not to say that they are beginner-friendly - there are no step-by-step guides here, no parts lists, etc. 

The modules have been built by me and they work more or less as intended but they may not always adhere exactly to the established Eurorack synth signal level [specifications](http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100t_e.htm) even if these have been used as guidelines for their construction.
Actual testing is usually limited to "sounds about right", "cool, it seems to work!" and "phew, no smoke!" so breadboarding the circuits and testing them yourself might be in order.  

The modules will fit in a standard 19" rack as specified [here](http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100m_e.htm) with holes for 3mm M3 screws. 

**See also the [hardware notes](hardware_notes.html) page for more information** 

## Eurorack Synth Modules

- [VCLFO](vclfo.html) - LFO module with voltage control of frequency 
- [MS20 VCF](ms20vcf.html) - a filter module derived from the Korg MS20 synth filter 
- [Bleep Drum](https://github.com/L71/BleepDrum-Eurorack) (repository link) - The Bleep Labs [Bleep Drum](http://bleeplabs.com/product/bleep-drum-midi/) Arduino drum machine, Eurorackified by me
